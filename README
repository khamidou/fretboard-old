WARNING : THIS IS AN OLD APP

Fretboard comes into two versions :
- the official, available here : http://github.com/khamidou/fretboard/tree/master
- this deprecated version.

This version is probably faster than the bleeding edge, but it's unmaintanable and has unneeded
dependecies (originally, I based fretboard on gtkguitune, a gtkmm-based guitar tuner, which 
explains that it depends on gtkmm though it's a daemon).
Use it only if you find the official version too slow.

What is Fretboard ?
--------------------
   Fretboard is a program that lets you use a musical instrument as an
   input device.
   Fretboard works only under the X Window system, however, it may be
   possible to port it to other systems than linux.
   It is actually an oscilloscope which counts the passes between two
   trigger levels per time, calculates the frequency and shows the
   tone on a tone-scale.

Resources
---------
   You need to have gtk and gtk-- (1.2.1 or later), as well as
   xautomation (http://hoopajoo.net/projects/xautomation.html)
   installed.
   
Customizing
-----------

   After having installed fretboard, you'll probably want to
   customize its behaviour. This is for that purpose that I
   added Python support to it. Each time a note is read,
   fretboard calls a python function named callback() defined
   in ~/.fretboard/callback.py.
   For more informations, see the commented examples in the sampleconfig 
   directory.

Design
------
   Fretboard was _not_ properly designed. Don't read the code,
   don't try to modify it, especially during nights of full moon. 
   I had better things to do than to write beautiful code, 
   so I reused this code. Yes, it uses gtkmm though it's a daemon.
   Yes, it allocs loads of things it won't use like menus, etc. No I don't
   think I will fix it because it works, and that I have better things to
   do than fixing some unbeliveably ugly code (you don't belive me ? 
   open guitune.cc and go to line 445. Now, try to understand what does the
   function proc_audio do).

How to build
------------
   (1) ./configure
   (2) make
   (3) make install
   (4) edit you startup files to launch the fretboard daemon
       on startup.

   ...ready? shred!
